===== Your background  =====
!bblock
* You have some experience in programming but have never tried to parallelize your codes
* Here I will base my examples on C/C++ using Message Passing Interface (MPI) and OpenMP. 
* I will also give you some simple hints on how to run and install codes on your laptop/office PC
* The programs and slides can be found at the weblink
* Good text: Karniadakis and Kirby, Parallel Scientific Computing in C++ and MPI, Cambridge.

We will discuss Message passing interface (MPI) and OpenMP.

* Develop codes locally, run with some few processes and test your codes.  Do benchmarking, timing and so forth on local nodes, for example your laptop or PC.  You can install MPICH2 on  your laptop/PC. 
* Test by typing *which mpd*
* When you are convinced that your codes run correctly, you start your production runs on available supercomputers, in our case *smaug* locally (to be discussed after Easter).

===== How do I run MPI on a PC/Laptop?  =====
!bblock
Most machines at computer labs at UiO are quad-cores
* Compile with mpicxx or mpic++ or mpif90
* Set up collaboration between processes and run 
!bc cppcod
mpd --ncpus=4 &
#  run code with
mpiexec -n 4 ./nameofprog
!ec
Here we declare that we will use 4 processes via the *-ncpus* option and via $-n 4$ when running.
* End with *mpdallexit*

!split
===== Can I do it on my own PC/laptop? =====
!bblock
Of course:
* go to the website of "Argonne National Lab":"http://www.mcs.anl.gov/research/projects/mpich2/"
* follow the instructions and install it on your own PC/laptop
* Versions for Ubuntu/Linux, windows and mac
* For windows, you may think of installing WUBI

===== What is Message Passing Interface (MPI)?  =====
!bblock

MPI is a library, not a language. It specifies the names, calling sequences and results of functions
or subroutines to be called from C/C++ or Fortran programs, and the classes and methods that make up the MPI C++
library. The programs that users write in Fortran, C or C++ are compiled with ordinary compilers and linked
with the MPI library.

MPI programs should be able to run
on all possible machines and run all MPI implementetations without change.

An MPI computation is a collection of processes communicating with messages.


!eblock
!split
===== Going Parallel with MPI =====
!bblock
_Task parallelism_: the work of a global problem can be divided
into a number of independent tasks, which rarely need to synchronize. 
Monte Carlo simulations or numerical integration are examples of this.


MPI is a message-passing library where all the routines
have corresponding C/C++-binding
!bc cppcod
   MPI_Command_name
!ec
and Fortran-binding (routine names are in uppercase, but can also be in lower case)
!bc forcod
   MPI_COMMAND_NAME
!ec

!split
===== MPI is a library  =====
!bblock
MPI is a library specification for the message passing interface,
proposed as a standard.

* independent of hardware;
* not a language or compiler specification;
* not a specific implementation or product.


A message passing standard for portability and ease-of-use. 
Designed for high performance.

Insert communication and synchronization functions where necessary.


!eblock
!split
===== The basic ideas of parallel computing =====
!bblock

* Pursuit of shorter computation time and larger simulation size gives rise to parallel computing.
* Multiple processors are involved to solve a global problem.
* The essence is to divide the entire computation evenly among collaborative processors.  Divide and conquer.
!eblock

!split
===== A rough classification of hardware models  =====
!bblock

* Conventional single-processor computers can be called SISD (single-instruction-single-data) machines.
* SIMD (single-instruction-multiple-data) machines incorporate the idea of parallel processing, which use a large number of processing units to execute the same instruction on different data.
* Modern parallel computers are so-called MIMD (multiple-instruction-multiple-data) machines and can execute different instruction streams in parallel on different data.


!eblock
!split
=====  Shared memory and distributed memory =====
!bblock

* One way of categorizing modern parallel computers is to look at the memory configuration.
* In shared memory systems the CPUs share the same address space. Any CPU can access any data in the global memory.
* In distributed memory systems each CPU has its own memory.

The CPUs are connected by some network and may exchange
messages.

!eblock

!split
=====    Different parallel programming paradigms  =====
!bblock

* _Task parallelism_:  the work of a global problem can be divided into a number of independent tasks, which rarely need to synchronize.  Monte Carlo simulation is one example. Integration is another. However this paradigm is of limited use.
* _Data parallelism_:  use of multiple threads (e.g. one thread per processor) to dissect loops over arrays etc.  This paradigm requires a single memory address space.  Communication and synchronization between processors are often hidden, thus easy to program. However, the user surrenders much control to a specialized compiler. Examples of data parallelism are compiler-based parallelization and OpenMP directives. 

!eblock
!split
=====    Different parallel programming paradigms =====
!bblock

* _Message passing_:  all involved processors have an independent memory address space. The user is responsible for  partitioning the data/work of a global problem and distributing the  subproblems to the processors. Collaboration between processors is achieved by explicit message passing, which is used for data transfer plus synchronization.

* This paradigm is the most general one where the user has full control. Better parallel efficiency is usually achieved by explicit message passing. However, message-passing programming is more difficult.


!eblock
!split
===== SPMD (single-program-multiple-data) =====
!bblock

Although message-passing programming supports MIMD, it 
suffices with an SPMD (single-program-multiple-data) model, which
is flexible enough for practical cases:

* Same executable for all the processors.
* Each processor works primarily with its assigned local data.
* Progression of code is allowed to differ between synchronization points.
* Possible to have a master/slave model. The standard option in Monte Carlo calculations and numerical integration.

!eblock
!split
=====    Today's situation of parallel computing  =====
!bblock

* Distributed memory is the dominant hardware configuration. There is a large diversity in these machines, from  MPP (massively parallel processing) systems to clusters of off-the-shelf PCs, which are very cost-effective.
* Message-passing is a mature programming paradigm and widely accepted. It often provides an efficient match to the hardware. It is primarily used for the distributed memory systems, but can also be used on shared memory systems.

* Modern nodes have nowadays several cores, which makes it interesting to use both shared memory (the given node) and distributed memory (several nodes with communication). This leads often to codes which use both MPI and OpenMP.

Our lectures will focus on both MPI and OpenMP.

!eblock

!split
=====  Overhead present in parallel computing =====
!bblock

* _Uneven load balance_:  not all the processors can perform useful work at all time.
* _Overhead of synchronization_
* _Overhead of communication_
* _Extra computation due to parallelization_

Due to the above overhead and that certain part of a sequential
algorithm cannot be parallelized we may not achieve an optimal parallelization.
!eblock


!split
=====    Parallelizing a sequential algorithm  =====
!bblock

* Identify the part(s) of a sequential algorithm that can be  executed in parallel. This is the difficult part,
* Distribute the global work and data among $P$ processors.

!eblock


!split
=====    Bindings to MPI routines  =====
!bblock


MPI is a message-passing library where all the routines
have corresponding C/C++-binding
!bc cppcod
   MPI_Command_name
!ec
and Fortran-binding (routine names are in uppercase, but can also be in lower case)
!bc forcod
   MPI_COMMAND_NAME
!ec
The discussion in these slides focuses on the C++ binding.

!split
===== Communicator  =====
!bblock
* A group of MPI processes with a name (context).
* Any process is identified by its rank. The rank is only meaningful within a particular communicator.
* By default communicator $MPI\_COMM\_WORLD$ contains all the MPI processes.
* Mechanism to identify subset of processes.
* Promotes modular design of parallel libraries.


!eblock


!split
=====  Some of the most  important MPI functions =====
!bblock



* $MPI\_Init$ - initiate an MPI computation
* $MPI\_Finalize$ - terminate the MPI computation and clean up
* $MPI\_Comm\_size$ - how many processes participate in a given MPI communicator?
* $MPI\_Comm\_rank$ - which one am I? (A number between 0 and size-1.)
* $MPI\_Send$ - send a message to a particular process within an MPI communicator
* $MPI\_Recv$ - receive a message from a particular process within an MPI communicator
* $MPI\_reduce$  or $MPI\_Allreduce$, send and receive messages

!eblock


!split
=====    The first MPI C/C++ program  =====
!bblock


Let every process write "Hello world" (oh not this program again!!) on the standard output. 
!bc cppcod
using namespace std;
#include <mpi.h>
#include <iostream>
int main (int nargs, char* args[])
{
int numprocs, my_rank;
//   MPI initializations
MPI_Init (&nargs, &args);
MPI_Comm_size (MPI_COMM_WORLD, &numprocs);
MPI_Comm_rank (MPI_COMM_WORLD, &my_rank);
cout << "Hello world, I have  rank " << my_rank << " out of " 
     << numprocs << endl;
//  End MPI
MPI_Finalize ();

CALL MPI_COMM_RANK(MPI_COMM_WORLD, my_rank, ierr)
WRITE(*,*)"Hello world, I've rank ",my_rank," out of ",size
CALL MPI_FINALIZE(ierr)

END PROGRAM hello
!ec

!split
=====    Note 1  =====
!bblock

* The output to screen is not ordered since all processes are trying to write  to screen simultaneously.
* It is the operating system which opts for an ordering.  
* If we wish to have an organized output, starting from the first process, we may rewrite our program as in the next example.

!eblock


!split
=====    Ordered output with $MPI\_Barrier$  =====
!bblock

!bc cppcod
int main (int nargs, char* args[])
{
 int numprocs, my_rank, i;
 MPI_Init (&nargs, &args);
 MPI_Comm_size (MPI_COMM_WORLD, &numprocs);
 MPI_Comm_rank (MPI_COMM_WORLD, &my_rank);
 for (i = 0; i < numprocs; i++) {}
 MPI_Barrier (MPI_COMM_WORLD);
 if (i == my_rank) {
 cout << "Hello world, I have  rank " << my_rank << 
        " out of " << numprocs << endl;}
      MPI_Finalize ();
!ec

!eblock


!split
=====    Note 2 =====
!bblock
* Here we have used the $MPI\_Barrier$ function to ensure that that every process has completed  its set of instructions in  a particular order.
* A barrier is a special collective operation that does not allow the processes to continue until all processes in the communicator (here $MPI\_COMM\_WORLD$) have called $MPI\_Barrier$. 
* The barriers make sure that all processes have reached the same point in the code. Many of the collective operations like $MPI\_ALLREDUCE$ to be discussed later, have the same property; that is, no process can exit the operation until all processes have started. 

However, this is slightly more time-consuming since the processes synchronize between themselves as many times as there
are processes.  In the next Hello world example we use the send and receive functions in order to a have a synchronized
action.

=====    Ordered output with $MPI\_Recv$ and $MPI\_Send$ =====
!bblock


!bc ccpcod

int numprocs, my_rank, flag;
MPI_Status status;
MPI_Init (&nargs, &args);
MPI_Comm_size (MPI_COMM_WORLD, &numprocs);
MPI_Comm_rank (MPI_COMM_WORLD, &my_rank);
if (my_rank > 0)
MPI_Recv (&flag, 1, MPI_INT, my_rank-1, 100, 
           MPI_COMM_WORLD, &status);
cout << "Hello world, I have  rank " << my_rank << " out of " 
<< numprocs << endl;
if (my_rank < numprocs-1)
MPI_Send (&my_rank, 1, MPI_INT, my_rank+1, 
          100, MPI_COMM_WORLD);
MPI_Finalize ();
!ec

!eblock


!split
=====    Note 3  =====
!bblock


The basic sending of messages is given by the function $MPI\_SEND$, which in C/C++
is defined as 
!bc cppcod
int MPI_Send(void *buf, int count, 
             MPI_Datatype datatype, 
             int dest, int tag, MPI_Comm comm)}
!ec
This single command allows the passing of any kind of variable, even a large array, to any group of tasks. 
The variable _buf_ is the variable we wish to send while _count_
is the  number of variables we are passing. If we are passing only a single value, this should be 1. 

If we transfer an array, it is  the overall size of the array. 
For example, if we want to send a 10 by 10 array, count would be $10\times 10=100$ 
since we are  actually passing 100 values.  


!eblock


!split
=====    Note 4  =====
!bblock

Once you have  sent a message, you must receive it on another task. The function $MPI\_RECV$
is similar to the send call.
!bc cppcod
int MPI_Recv( void *buf, int count, MPI_Datatype datatype, 
            int source, 
            int tag, MPI_Comm comm, MPI_Status *status )
!ec

The arguments that are different from those in MPI\_SEND are
_buf_ which  is the name of the variable where you will  be storing the received data, 
_source_ which  replaces the destination in the send command. This is the return ID of the sender.

Finally,  we have used  $MPI\_Status\_status$,  
where one can check if the receive was completed.

The output of this code is the same as the previous example, but now
process 0 sends a message to process 1, which forwards it further
to process 2, and so forth.

===== How do I use $MPI\_reduce$? =====
!bblock

Here we have used
!bc cppcod
MPI_reduce( void *senddata, void* resultdata, int count, 
     MPI_Datatype datatype, MPI_Op, int root, MPI_Comm comm)
!ec

The two variables $senddata$ and $resultdata$ are obvious, besides the fact that one sends the address
of the variable or the first element of an array.  If they are arrays they need to have the same size. 
The variable $count$ represents the total dimensionality, 1 in case of just one variable, 
while $MPI\_Datatype$ 
defines the type of variable which is sent and received.  

The new feature is $MPI\_Op$. It defines the type
of operation we want to do. 
!eblock

!split
===== More on $MPI\_Reduce$ =====
!bblock
In our case, since we are summing
the rectangle  contributions from every process we define  $MPI\_Op = MPI\_SUM$.
If we have an array or matrix we can search for the largest og smallest element by sending either $MPI\_MAX$ or 
$MPI\_MIN$.  If we want the location as well (which array element) we simply transfer 
$MPI\_MAXLOC$ or $MPI\_MINOC$. If we want the product we write $MPI\_PROD$. 

$MPI\_Allreduce$ is defined as
!bc cppcod     
MPI_Allreduce( void *senddata, void* resultdata, int count, 
          MPI_Datatype datatype, MPI_Op, MPI_Comm comm)        
!ec 


!eblock

!split
=====     Dissection of trapezoidal rule with $MPI\_reduce$ =====
!bblock

We use $MPI\_reduce$ to collect data from each process. Note also the use of the function 
$MPI\_Wtime$. 
!bc cppcod
//  this function defines the function to integrate
double int_function(double x)
{
  double value = 4./(1.+x*x);
  return value;
} // end of function to evaluate

{
  double trapez_sum;
  double fa, fb, x, step;
  int    j;
  step=(b-a)/((double) n);
  fa=(*func)(a)/2. ;

=====     Optimization and profiling =====
!bblock


Till now we have not paid much attention to speed and possible optimization possibilities
inherent in the various compilers. We have compiled and linked as
!bc cppcod
mpic++  -c  mycode.cpp
mpic++  -o  mycode.exe  mycode.o
!ec
For Fortran replace with mpif90.
This is what we call a flat compiler option and should be used when we develop the code.
It produces normally a very large and slow code when translated to machine instructions.
We use this option for debugging and for establishing the correct program output because
every operation is done precisely as the user specified it.

It is instructive to look up the compiler manual for further instructions
!bc cppcod
man mpic++  >  out_to_file
!ec


!eblock
!split
===== More on optimization =====
!bblock
We have additional compiler options for optimization. These may include procedure inlining where 
performance may be improved, moving constants inside loops outside the loop, 
identify potential parallelism, include automatic vectorization or replace a division with a reciprocal
and a multiplication if this speeds up the code.
!bc cppcod
mpic++  -O3 -c  mycode.cpp
mpic++  -O3 -o  mycode.exe  mycode.o
!ec
This is the recommended option. _But you must check that you get the same results as previously_.


!eblock
!split
=====    Optimization and profiling  =====
!bblock
It is also useful to profile your program under the development stage.
You would then compile with 
!bc cppcod
mpic++  -pg -O3 -c  mycode.cpp
mpic++  -pg -O3 -o  mycode.exe  mycode.o
!ec
After you have run the code you can obtain the profiling information via
!bc cppcod
gprof mycode.exe >  out_to_profile
!ec
When you have profiled properly your code, you must take out this option as it 
increases your CPU expenditure.
For memory tests use "valgrind":"http:www.valgrind.org". An excellent GUI is also Qt, with debugging facilities.

Other hints
* avoid if tests or call to functions inside loops, if possible. 
* avoid multiplication with constants inside loops if possible

Bad code
!bc cppcod
for i = 1:n
    a(i) = b(i) +c*d
    e = g(k)
end

Better code
!bc cppcod
temp = c*d
for i = 1:n
    a(i) = b(i) + temp

=====    What is OpenMP =====
!bblock
* OpenMP provides high-level thread programming
* Multiple cooperating threads are allowed to run simultaneously
* Threads are created and destroyed dynamically in a fork-join pattern
  *  An OpenMP program consists of a number of parallel regions
  *  Between two parallel regions there is only one master thread
  *  In the beginning of a parallel region, a team of new threads is spawned
  * The newly spawned threads work simultaneously with the master thread
  * At the end of a parallel region, the new threads are destroyed

Different threads do different tasks independently, each section is executed by one thread.

=====     Single execution  =====
!bblock
!bc cppcod
#pragma omp single { ... }
!ec
The code is executed by one thread only, no guarantee which thread

Can introduce an implicit barrier at the end
!bc cppcod
#pragma omp master { ... }
!ec
Code executed by the master thread, guaranteed and no implicit barrier at the end.

=====    Coordination and synchronization  =====
!bblock
!bc cppcod
#pragma omp barrier
!ec 
Synchronization, must be encountered by all threads in a team (or none)
!bc cppcod
#pragma omp ordered { a block of codes }
!ec
is another form of synchronization (in sequential order).
The form
!bc cppcod
#pragma omp critical { a block of codes }
!ec
and 
!bc cppcod
#pragma omp atomic { single assignment statement }
!ec
is  more efficient than 
!bc cppcod
#pragma omp critical

=====    Data scope  =====
!bblock
* OpenMP data scope attribute clauses:
 * _shared_
 * _private_
 * _firstprivate_
 * _lastprivate_
 * _reduction_

What are the purposes of these attributes
* define how and which variables are transferred to a parallel region (and back)
* define which variables are visible to all threads in a parallel region, and which variables are privately allocated to each thread


!eblock


!split
=====    Some remarks  =====
!bblock

* When entering a parallel region, the _private_ clause ensures each thread having its own new variable instances. The new variables are assumed to be uninitialized.
* A shared variable exists in only one memory location and all threads can read and write to that address. It is the programmer's responsibility to ensure that multiple threads properly access a shared variable.
* The _firstprivate_ clause combines the behavior of the private clause with automatic initialization.
* The _lastprivate_ clause combines the behavior of the private clause with a copy back (from the last loop iteration or section) to the original variable outside the parallel region.

=====    Parallelizing nested for-loops =====
!bblock

*  Serial code
!bc cppcod
for (i=0; i<100; i++)
for (j=0; j<100; j++)
a[i][j] = b[i][j] + c[i][j]
!ec

* Parallelization
!bc cppcod
#pragma omp parallel for private(j)
for (i=0; i<100; i++)
for (j=0; j<100; j++)
a[i][j] = b[i][j] + c[i][j]
!ec

* Why not parallelize the inner loop? to save overhead of repeated thread forks-joins

* Why must _j_ be private? To avoid race condition among the threads

=====    Nested parallelism  =====
!bblock
When a thread in a parallel region encounters another parallel construct, it
may create a new team of threads and become the master of the new
team.

#pragma omp parallel num_threads(4)
{
/* .... */
#pragma omp parallel num_threads(2)
{
//  
}
}

=====    Parallel tasks =====
!bblock
!bc cppcod
#pragma omp task 
#pragma omp parallel shared(p_vec) private(i)

#pragma omp single
{
for (i=0; i<N; i++) {
double r = random_number();
if (p_vec[i] > r) {
#pragma omp task
do_work (p_vec[i]);
