\paragraph{}
An operator is defined as $\hat{O}$ throughout. Unless otherwise specified the number of particles is
always $N$ and $d$ is the dimension of the system.  In nuclear physics
we normally define the total number of particles to be $A=N+Z$, where
$N$ is total number of neutrons and $Z$ the total number of
protons. In case of other baryons such isobars $\Delta$ or various
hyperons such as $\Lambda$ or $\Sigma$, one needs to add their
definitions.  Hereafter, $N$ is reserved for the total number of
particles, unless otherwise specificied.

The quantum numbers of a single-particle state in coordinate space are
defined by the variable 
\[
x=({\bf r},\sigma), 
\]
where 
\[
{\bf r}\in {\mathbb{R}}^{d},
\]
with $d=1,2,3$ represents the spatial coordinates and $\sigma$ is the eigenspin of the particle. For fermions with eigenspin $1/2$ this means that
\[
 x\in {\mathbb{R}}^{d}\oplus (\frac{1}{2}),
\]
and the integral $\int dx = \sum_{\sigma}\int d^dr = \sum_{\sigma}\int d{\bf r}$,

The quantum mechanical wave function of a given state with quantum numbers $\lambda$ (encompassing all quantum numbers needed to specify the system), ignoring time, is
\[
\Psi_{\lambda}=\Psi_{\lambda}(x_1,x_2,\dots,x_N),
\]
with $x_i=({\bf r}_i,\sigma_i)$ and the projection of $\sigma_i$ takes the values
$\{-1/2,+1/2\}$ for particles with spin $1/2$. 
We will hereafter always refer to $\Psi_{\lambda}$ as the exact wave function, and if the ground state is not degenerate we label it as 
\[
\Psi_0=\Psi_0(x_1,x_2,\dots,x_N).

Since the solution $\Psi_{\lambda}$ seldomly can be found in closed form, approximations are sought. Here we define an approximative wave function or an ansatz to the exact wave function as

with
\[
\Phi_0=\Phi_0(x_1,x_2,\dots,x_N),

The wave function $\Psi_{\lambda}$ is sought in the Hilbert space of either symmetric or anti-symmetric $N$-body functions, namely

\Psi_{\lambda}\in {\cal H}_N:= {\cal H}_1\oplus{\cal H}_1\oplus\dots\oplus{\cal H}_1,
\]
where the single-particle Hilbert space $\hat{H}_1$ is the space of square integrable functions over
$\in {\mathbb{R}}^{d}\oplus (\sigma)$

Our Hamiltonian is invariant under the permutation (interchange) of two particles.
Since we deal with fermions however, the total wave function is antisymmetric.
Let $\hat{P}$ be an operator which interchanges two particles.
Due to the symmetries we have ascribed to our Hamiltonian, this operator commutes with the total Hamiltonian,
\[
[\hat{H},\hat{P}] = 0,
\]
meaning that $\Psi_{\lambda}(x_1, x_2, \dots , x_N)$ is an eigenfunction of 
$\hat{P}$ as well, that is
\[
\hat{P}_{ij}\Psi_{\lambda}(x_1, x_2, \dots,x_i,\dots,x_j,\dots,x_N)=
\beta\Psi_{\lambda}(x_1, x_2, \dots,x_j,\dots,x_i,\dots,x_N),
\]
where $\beta$ is the eigenvalue of $\hat{P}$. We have introduced the suffix $ij$ in order to indicate that we permute particles $i$ and $j$.
The Pauli principle tells us that the total wave function for a system of fermions
has to be antisymmetric, resulting in the eigenvalue $\beta = -1$.

The Schrodinger equation reads

E_\lambda  \Psi_\lambda(x_1, x_2, \dots , x_N), \label{eq:basicSE1}
\end{equation}
where the vector $x_i$ represents the coordinates (spatial and spin) of particle $i$, $\lambda$ stands  for all the quantum

$\Psi$ refers to the exact eigenfunction, unless otherwise stated.

We write the Hamilton operator, or Hamiltonian,  in a generic way 
\[
	\hat{H} = \hat{T} + \hat{V} 
\]
where $\hat{T}$  represents the kinetic energy of the system
\[
	\hat{T} = \sum_{i=1}^N \frac{\mathbf{p}_i^2}{2m_i} = \sum_{i=1}^N \left( -\frac{\hbar^2}{2m_i} \mathbf{\nabla_i}^2 \right) =
		\sum_{i=1}^N t(x_i)
\]
while the operator $\hat{V}$ for the potential energy is given by
\begin{equation}
	\hat{V} = \sum_{i=1}^N \hat{u}_{\mathrm{ext}}(x_i) + \sum_{ji=1}^N v(x_i,x_j)+\sum_{ijk=1}^Nv(x_i,x_j,x_k)+\dots
\label{eq:firstv}
\end{equation}
Hereafter we use natural units, viz.~$\hbar=c=e=1$, with $e$ the elementary charge and $c$ the speed of light. This means that momenta and masses
have dimension energy.

If one does quantum chemistry, after having introduced the  Born-Oppenheimer approximation which effectively freezes out the nucleonic degrees of freedom, the Hamiltonian for $N=n_e$ electrons takes the following form 
\[
  \hat{H} = \sum_{i=1}^{n_e} t(x_i) - \sum_{i=1}^{n_e} k\frac{Z}{r_i} + \sum_{i < j}^{n_e} \frac{k}{r_{ij}},
\]
with $k=1.44$ eVnm
% --- end paragraph admon ---




% !split
\subsection{Definitions and notations}

\paragraph{}
We can rewrite this as
\begin{equation}
    \hat{H} = \hat{H}_0 + \hat{H}_I 
    = \sum_{i=1}^{n_e}\hat{h}_0(x_i) + \sum_{i < j}^{n_e}\frac{1}{r_{ij}},
\label{H1H2}
\end{equation}
where  we have defined 
\[
r_{ij}=| {\bf r}_i-{\bf r}_j|,
\]
 and
\begin{equation}
  \hat{h}_0(x_i) =  \hat{t}(x_i) - \frac{Z}{x_i}.
\label{hi}
\end{equation}
The first term of Eq.~(\ref{H1H2}), $H_0$, is the sum of the $N$
\emph{one-body} Hamiltonians $\hat{h}_0$. Each individual
Hamiltonian $\hat{h}_0$ contains the kinetic energy operator of an
electron and its potential energy due to the attraction of the
nucleus. The second term, $H_I$, is the sum of the $n_e(n_e-1)/2$
two-body interactions between each pair of electrons. Note that the double sum carries a restriction $i < j$.
% --- end paragraph admon ---




% !split
\subsection{Definitions and notations}

% --- begin paragraph admon ---
\paragraph{}
The potential energy term due to the attraction of the nucleus defines the onebody field $u_i=u_{\mathrm{ext}}(x_i)$ of Eq.~(\ref{eq:firstv}).
We have moved this term into the $\hat{H}_0$ part of the Hamiltonian, instead of keeping  it in $\hat{V}$ as in  Eq.~(\ref{eq:firstv}).
The reason is that we will hereafter treat $\hat{H}_0$ as our non-interacting  Hamiltonian. For a many-body wavefunction $\Phi_{\lambda}$ defined by an  
appropriate single-particle basis, we may solve exactly the non-interacting eigenvalue problem 
\[
\hat{H}_0\Phi_{\lambda}= w_{\lambda}\Phi_{\lambda},
\]
with $w_{\lambda}$ being the non-interacting energy. This energy is defined by the sum over single-particle energies to be defined below.
For atoms the single-particle energies could be the hydrogen-like single-particle energies corrected for the charge $Z$. For nuclei and quantum
dots, these energies could be given by the harmonic oscillator in three and two dimensions, respectively.

% !split
\subsection{Definitions and notations}

% --- begin paragraph admon ---
\paragraph{}
We will assume that the interacting part of the Hamiltonian
can be approximated by a two-body interaction.
This means that our Hamiltonian is written as 
\begin{equation}
    \hat{H} = \hat{H}_0 + \hat{H}_I 
    = \sum_{i=1}^N \hat{h}_0(x_i) + \sum_{i < j}^N V(r_{ij}),
\label{Hnuclei}
\end{equation}
with 
\begin{equation}
  H_0=\sum_{i=1}^N \hat{h}_0(x_i) =  \sum_{i=1}^N\left(\hat{t}(x_i) + \hat{u}_{\mathrm{ext}}(x_i)\right).
\label{hinuclei}
\end{equation}
The onebody part $u_{\mathrm{ext}}(x_i)$ is normally approximated by a harmonic oscillator potential or the Coulomb interaction an electron feels from the nucleus. However, other potentials are fully possible, such as 
one derived from the self-consistent solution of the Hartree-Fock equations.

In our case we assume that  we can approximate the exact eigenfunction with a Slater determinant

The single-particle function $\psi_{\alpha}(x_i)$  are eigenfunctions of the onebody
Hamiltonian $h_i$, that is

with eigenvalues 
\[
\hat{h}_0(x_i) \psi_{\alpha}(x_i)=\left(\hat{t}(x_i) + \hat{u}_{\mathrm{ext}}(x_i)\right)\psi_{\alpha}(x_i)=\varepsilon_{\alpha}\psi_{\alpha}(x_i).
\]
The energies $\varepsilon_{\alpha}$ are the so-called non-interacting single-particle energies, or unperturbed energies. 
The total energy is in this case the sum over all  single-particle energies, if no two-body or more complicated
many-body interactions are present.

Let us denote the ground state energy by $E_0$. According to the
variational principle we have
\[
  E_0 \le E[\Phi] = \int \Phi^*\hat{H}\Phi d\mathbf{\tau}
\]
where $\Phi$ is a trial function which we assume to be normalized
\[
  \int \Phi^*\Phi d\mathbf{\tau} = 1,
\]
where we have used the shorthand $d\mathbf{\tau}=d\mathbf{r}_1d\mathbf{r}_2\dots d\mathbf{r}_N$.

\paragraph{}
In the Hartree-Fock method the trial function is the Slater
determinant of Eq.~(\ref{eq:HartreeFockDet}) which can be rewritten as 
\[
  \Phi(x_1,x_2,\dots,x_N,\alpha,\beta,\dots,\nu) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{N!}}\sum_{P} (-)^P\hat{P}\psi_{\alpha}(x_1)
    \psi_{\beta}(x_2)\dots\psi_{\nu}(x_N)=\sqrt{N!}\hat{A}\Phi_H,

where we have introduced the antisymmetrization operator $\hat{A}$ defined by the 
summation over all possible permutations of two particles.

It is defined as
\begin{equation}
  \hat{A} = \frac{1}{N!}\sum_{p} (-)^p\hat{P},

with $p$ standing for the number of permutations. We have introduced for later use the so-called
Hartree-function, defined by the simple product of all possible single-particle functions
\[
  \Phi_H(x_1,x_2,\dots,x_N,\alpha,\beta,\dots,\nu) =
  \psi_{\alpha}(x_1)

Both $\hat{H}_0$ and $\hat{H}_I$ are invariant under all possible permutations of any two particles
and hence commute with $\hat{A}$
\begin{equation}
  [H_0,\hat{A}] = [H_I,\hat{A}] = 0. \label{commutionAntiSym}
\end{equation}
Furthermore, $\hat{A}$ satisfies
\begin{equation}
  \hat{A}^2 = \hat{A},  \label{AntiSymSquared}

since every permutation of the Slater

The expectation value of $\hat{H}_0$ 
\[
  \int \Phi^*\hat{H}_0\Phi d\mathbf{\tau} 
  = N! \int \Phi_H^*\hat{A}\hat{H}_0\hat{A}\Phi_H d\mathbf{\tau}
\]
is readily reduced to
\[
  \int \Phi^*\hat{H}_0\Phi d\mathbf{\tau} 
  = N! \int \Phi_H^*\hat{H}_0\hat{A}\Phi_H d\mathbf{\tau},
\]
where we have used Eqs.~(\ref{commutionAntiSym}) and
(\ref{AntiSymSquared}). The next step is to replace the antisymmetrization
operator by its definition and to
replace $\hat{H}_0$ with the sum of one-body operators
\[
  \int \Phi^*\hat{H}_0\Phi  d\mathbf{\tau}
  = \sum_{i=1}^N \sum_{p} (-)^p\int 
  \Phi_H^*\hat{h}_0\hat{P}\Phi_H d\mathbf{\tau}.

The integral vanishes if two or more particles are permuted in only one
of the Hartree-functions $\Phi_H$ because the individual single-particle wave functions are
orthogonal. We obtain then
\[
  \int \Phi^*\hat{H}_0\Phi  d\mathbf{\tau}= \sum_{i=1}^N \int \Phi_H^*\hat{h}_0\Phi_H  d\mathbf{\tau}.
\]
Orthogonality of the single-particle functions allows us to further simplify the integral, and we
arrive at the following expression for the expectation values of the
sum of one-body Hamiltonians 
\begin{equation}
  \int \Phi^*\hat{H}_0\Phi  d\mathbf{\tau}
  = \sum_{\mu=1}^N \int \psi_{\mu}^*(\mathbf{r})\hat{h}_0\psi_{\mu}(\mathbf{r})

We introduce the following shorthand for the above integral
\[
\langle \mu | \hat{h}_0 | \mu \rangle = \int \psi_{\mu}^*(\mathbf{r})\hat{h}_0\psi_{\mu}(\mathbf{r}),

and rewrite Eq.~(\ref{H1Expectation}) as
\begin{equation}
  \int \Phi^*\hat{H}_0\Phi  d\mathbf{\tau}
  = \sum_{\mu=1}^N \langle \mu | \hat{h}_0 | \mu \rangle.

The expectation value of the two-body part of the Hamiltonian is obtained in a
similar manner. We have

  \int \Phi^*\hat{H}_I\Phi d\mathbf{\tau} 
  = N! \int \Phi_H^*\hat{A}\hat{H}_I\hat{A}\Phi_H d\mathbf{\tau},

which reduces to
\[
 \int \Phi^*\hat{H}_I\Phi d\mathbf{\tau} 
  = \sum_{i\le j=1}^N \sum_{p} (-)^p\int 
  \Phi_H^*V(r_{ij})\hat{P}\Phi_H d\mathbf{\tau},

Hamiltonian.

Because of the dependence on the inter-particle distance $r_{ij}$,  permutations of
any two particles no longer vanish, and we get

  = \sum_{i < j=1}^N \int  
  \Phi_H^*V(r_{ij})(1-P_{ij})\Phi_H d\mathbf{\tau}.
\]
where $P_{ij}$ is the permutation operator that interchanges
particle $i$ and particle $j$. Again we use the assumption that the single-particle wave functions
are orthogonal.

The first term is the so-called direct term. It is frequently also called the  Hartree term,

\paragraph{}
The direct and exchange matrix elements can be  brought together if we define the antisymmetrized matrix element
\[
\langle \mu\nu|\hat{v}|\mu\nu\rangle_{\mathrm{AS}}= \langle \mu\nu|\hat{v}|\mu\nu\rangle-\langle \mu\nu|\hat{v}|\nu\mu\rangle,
\]
or for a general matrix element  
\[
\langle \mu\nu|\hat{v}|\sigma\tau\rangle_{\mathrm{AS}}= \langle \mu\nu|\hat{v}|\sigma\tau\rangle-\langle \mu\nu|\hat{v}|\tau\sigma\rangle.
\]
It has the symmetry property
\[
\langle \mu\nu|\hat{v}|\sigma\tau\rangle_{\mathrm{AS}}= -\langle \mu\nu|\hat{v}|\tau\sigma\rangle_{\mathrm{AS}}=-\langle \nu\mu|\hat{v}|\sigma\tau\rangle_{\mathrm{AS}}.

\paragraph{}
The antisymmetric matrix element is also hermitian, implying 
\[
\langle \mu\nu|\hat{v}|\sigma\tau\rangle_{\mathrm{AS}}= \langle \sigma\tau|\hat{v}|\mu\nu\rangle_{\mathrm{AS}}.
\]
With these notations we rewrite Eq.~(\ref{H2Expectation}) as 
\begin{equation}
  \int \Phi^*\hat{H}_I\Phi d\mathbf{\tau} 
  = \frac{1}{2}\sum_{\mu=1}^N\sum_{\nu=1}^N \langle \mu\nu|\hat{v}|\mu\nu\rangle_{\mathrm{AS}}.
\label{H2Expectation2}
\end{equation}

\paragraph{}
Combining Eqs.~(\ref{H1Expectation1}) and
(\ref{H2Expectation2}) we obtain the energy functional 
\begin{equation}
  E[\Phi] 
  = \sum_{\mu=1}^N \langle \mu | \hat{h}_0 | \mu \rangle +
  \frac{1}{2}\sum_{{\mu}=1}^N\sum_{{\nu}=1}^N \langle \mu\nu|\hat{v}|\mu\nu\rangle_{\mathrm{AS}}.
\label{FunctionalEPhi}
\end{equation}
which we will use as our starting point for the Hartree-Fock calculations later in this course.
