Given a hamiltonian $H$ and a trial wave function $\Psi_T$, the variational principle states that the expectation value of $\langle H \rangle$, defined through 
!bt
\[
   E[H]= \langle H \rangle =
   \frac{\int d\bm{R}\Psi^{\ast}_T(\bm{R})H(\bm{R})\Psi_T(\bm{R})}
        {\int d\bm{R}\Psi^{\ast}_T(\bm{R})\Psi_T(\bm{R})},
\]
!et
is an upper bound to the ground state energy $E_0$ of the hamiltonian $H$, that is 
!bt
\[
    E_0 \le \langle H \rangle .
\]
!et
In general, the integrals involved in the calculation of various  expectation values  are multi-dimensional ones. Traditional integration methods such as the Gauss-Legendre will not be adequate for say the  computation of the energy of a many-body system.

The trial wave function can be expanded in the eigenstates of the hamiltonian since they form a complete set, viz.,
!bt
\[
   \Psi_T(\bm{R})=\sum_i a_i\Psi_i(\bm{R}),
\]
!et
and assuming the set of eigenfunctions to be normalized one obtains 
!bt
\[
     \frac{\sum_{nm}a^*_ma_n \int d\bm{R}\Psi^{\ast}_m(\bm{R})H(\bm{R})\Psi_n(\bm{R})}
        {\sum_{nm}a^*_ma_n \int d\bm{R}\Psi^{\ast}_m(\bm{R})\Psi_n(\bm{R})} =\frac{\sum_{n}a^2_n E_n}
        {\sum_{n}a^2_n} \ge E_0,
\]
!et
where we used that $H(\bm{R})\Psi_n(\bm{R})=E_n\Psi_n(\bm{R})$.
In general, the integrals involved in the calculation of various  expectation
values  are multi-dimensional ones. 
The variational principle yields the lowest state of a given symmetry.

===== Quantum Monte Carlo Motivation =====

In most cases, a wave function has only small values in large parts of 
configuration space, and a straightforward procedure which uses
homogenously distributed random points in configuration space 
will most likely lead to poor results. This may suggest that some kind
of importance sampling combined with e.g., the Metropolis algorithm 
may be  a more efficient way of obtaining the ground state energy.
The hope is then that those regions of configurations space where
the wave function assumes appreciable values are sampled more 
efficiently.

===== Quantum Monte Carlo Motivation =====
!bblock
The tedious part in a VMC calculation is the search for the variational
minimum. A good knowledge of the system is required in order to carry out
reasonable VMC calculations. This is not always the case, 
and often VMC calculations 
serve rather as the starting
point for so-called diffusion Monte Carlo calculations (DMC). DMC is a way of
solving exactly the many-body Schroedinger equation by means of 
a stochastic procedure. A good guess on the binding energy
and its wave function is however necessary. 
A carefully performed VMC calculation can aid in this context.

* Construct first a trial wave function $\psi_T(\bm{R},\bm{\alpha})$,  for a many-body system consisting of $N$ particles located at positions 
$\bm{R}=(\bm{R}_1,\dots ,\bm{R}_N)$. The trial wave function depends on $\alpha$ variational parameters $\bm{\alpha}=(\alpha_1,\dots ,\alpha_M)$.
* Then we evaluate the expectation value of the hamiltonian $H$ 
!bt
\[
   E[H]=\langle H \rangle =
   \frac{\int d\bm{R}\Psi^{\ast}_{T}(\bm{R},\bm{\alpha})H(\bm{R})\Psi_{T}(\bm{R},\bm{\alpha})}
        {\int d\bm{R}\Psi^{\ast}_{T}(\bm{R},\bm{\alpha})\Psi_{T}(\bm{R},\bm{\alpha})}.
\]
!et
* Thereafter we vary $\alpha$ according to some minimization algorithm and return to the first step.

!bblock Basic steps
Choose a trial wave function
$\psi_T(\bm{R})$.
!bt
\[
   P(\bm{R})= \frac{\left|\psi_T(\bm{R})\right|^2}{\int \left|\psi_T(\bm{R})\right|^2d\bm{R}}.
\]
!et
This is our new probability distribution function  (PDF).
The approximation to the expectation value of the Hamiltonian is now 
!bt
\[
   E[H(\bm{\alpha})] = 
   \frac{\int d\bm{R}\Psi^{\ast}_T(\bm{R},\bm{\alpha})H(\bm{R})\Psi_T(\bm{R},\bm{\alpha})}
        {\int d\bm{R}\Psi^{\ast}_T(\bm{R},\bm{\alpha})\Psi_T(\bm{R},\bm{\alpha})}.

\]
!et
called the local energy, which, together with our trial PDF yields
!bt
\[
  E[H(\bm{\alpha})]=\int P(\bm{R})E_L(\bm{R}) d\bm{R}\approx \frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^NP(\bm{R_i},\bm{\alpha})E_L(\bm{R_i},\bm{\alpha})

with $N$ being the number of Monte Carlo samples.

The Algorithm for performing a variational Monte Carlo calculations runs thus as this
       
  *  Initialisation: Fix the number of Monte Carlo steps. Choose an initial $\bm{R}$ and variational parameters $\alpha$ and calculate $\left|\psi_T^{\alpha}(\bm{R})\right|^2$. 
  *  Initialise the energy and the variance and start the Monte Carlo calculation.
     *  Calculate  a trial position  $\bm{R}_p=\bm{R}+r*step$ where $r$ is a random variable $r \in [0,1]$.
     *  Metropolis algorithm to accept or reject this move  $w = P(\bm{R}_p)/P(\bm{R})$.
     *  If the step is accepted, then we set $\bm{R}=\bm{R}_p$. 
     *  Update averages
  *  Finish and compute final averages.
      
Observe that the jumping in space is governed by the variable *step*. This is Called brute-force sampling.
Need importance sampling to get more relevant sampling, see lectures below.

We note that at $\alpha=1$ we obtain the exact
result, and the variance is zero, as it should. The reason is that 
we then have the exact wave function, and the action of the hamiltionan
on the wave function
!bt
\[
   H\psi = \mathrm{constant}\times \psi,
\]
!et
yields just a constant. The integral which defines various 
expectation values involving moments of the hamiltonian becomes then
!bt
\[
   \langle H^n \rangle =
   \frac{\int d\bm{R}\Psi^{\ast}_T(\bm{R})H^n(\bm{R})\Psi_T(\bm{R})}
        {\int d\bm{R}\Psi^{\ast}_T(\bm{R})\Psi_T(\bm{R})}=
\mathrm{constant}\times\frac{\int d\bm{R}\Psi^{\ast}_T(\bm{R})\Psi_T(\bm{R})}
        {\int d\bm{R}\Psi^{\ast}_T(\bm{R})\Psi_T(\bm{R})}=\mathrm{constant}.
\]
!et
_This gives an important information: the exact wave function leads to zero variance!_
Variation is then performed by minimizing both the energy and the variance.

===== Quantum Monte Carlo: the helium atom =====

The helium atom consists of two electrons and a nucleus with
charge $Z=2$. 
The contribution  
to the potential energy due to the attraction from the nucleus is
!bt
\[
   -\frac{2ke^2}{r_1}-\frac{2ke^2}{r_2},
\] 
!et
and if we add the repulsion arising from the two 
interacting electrons, we obtain the potential energy
!bt
\[
 V(r_1, r_2)=-\frac{2ke^2}{r_1}-\frac{2ke^2}{r_2}+
               \frac{ke^2}{r_{12}},
\]
!et
with the electrons separated at a distance 
$r_{12}=|\bm{r}_1-\bm{r}_2|$.

The hamiltonian becomes then
!bt
\[
   \hat{H}=-\frac{\hbar^2\nabla_1^2}{2m}-\frac{\hbar^2\nabla_2^2}{2m}
          -\frac{2ke^2}{r_1}-\frac{2ke^2}{r_2}+
               \frac{ke^2}{r_{12}},
\]
!et
and  Schroedingers equation reads
!bt
\[
   \hat{H}\psi=E\psi.
\]
!et
All observables are evaluated with respect to the probability distribution
!bt
\[
   P(\bm{R})= \frac{\left|\psi_T(\bm{R})\right|^2}{\int \left|\psi_T(\bm{R})\right|^2d\bm{R}}.
\]
!et
generated by the trial wave function.   
The trial wave function must approximate an exact 
eigenstate in order that accurate results are to be obtained.

Choice of trial wave function for Helium:
Assume $r_1 \rightarrow 0$.
!bt
\[
   E_L(\bm{R})=\frac{1}{\psi_T(\bm{R})}H\psi_T(\bm{R})=
     \frac{1}{\psi_T(\bm{R})}\left(-\frac{1}{2}\nabla^2_1
     -\frac{Z}{r_1}\right)\psi_T(\bm{R}) + \mathrm{finite \hspace{0.1cm}terms}.
\]
!et
!bt
\[ 
    E_L(R)=
    \frac{1}{{\cal R}_T(r_1)}\left(-\frac{1}{2}\frac{d^2}{dr_1^2}-
     \frac{1}{r_1}\frac{d}{dr_1}
     -\frac{Z}{r_1}\right){\cal R}_T(r_1) + \mathrm{finite\hspace{0.1cm} terms}
\]
!et
For small values of $r_1$, the terms which dominate are
!bt
\[ 
    \lim_{r_1 \rightarrow 0}E_L(R)=
    \frac{1}{{\cal R}_T(r_1)}\left(-
     \frac{1}{r_1}\frac{d}{dr_1}
     -\frac{Z}{r_1}\right){\cal R}_T(r_1),
\]
!et
since the second derivative does not diverge due to the finiteness of  $\Psi$ at the origin.
!eblock




!split
===== Quantum Monte Carlo: the helium atom =====
!bblock
This results in
!bt
\[
     \frac{1}{{\cal R}_T(r_1)}\frac{d {\cal R}_T(r_1)}{dr_1}=-Z,
\]
!et
and
!bt
\[
   {\cal R}_T(r_1)\propto e^{-Zr_1}.
\]
!et
A similar condition applies to electron 2 as well. 
For orbital momenta $l > 0$ we have 
!bt
\[
     \frac{1}{{\cal R}_T(r)}\frac{d {\cal R}_T(r)}{dr}=-\frac{Z}{l+1}.
\]
!et
Similarly, studying the case $r_{12}\rightarrow 0$ we can write 
a possible trial wave function as
!bt
\[
   \psi_T(\bm{R})=e^{-\alpha(r_1+r_2)}e^{\beta r_{12}}.
    label{eq:wavehelium2}
\]
!et
The last equation can be generalized to
!bt
\[
   \psi_T(\bm{R})=\phi(\bm{r}_1)\phi(\bm{r}_2)\dots\phi(\bm{r}_N)
                   \prod_{i < j}f(r_{ij}),

During the development of our code we need to make several checks. It is also very instructive to compute a closed form expression for the local energy. Since our wave function is rather simple  it is straightforward
to find an analytic expressions.  Consider first the case of the simple helium function 
!bt
\[
   \Psi_T(\bm{r}_1,\bm{r}_2) = e^{-\alpha(r_1+r_2)}
\]
!et
The local energy is for this case 
!bt
\[ 
E_{L1} = \left(\alpha-Z\right)\left(\frac{1}{r_1}+\frac{1}{r_2}\right)+\frac{1}{r_{12}}-\alpha^2
\]
!et
which gives an expectation value for the local energy given by
!bt
\[
\langle E_{L1} \rangle = \alpha^2-2\alpha\left(Z-\frac{5}{16}\right)
\]
!et
!eblock

===== The first attempt at solving the Helium atom =====

With closed form formulae we  can speed up the computation of the correlation. In our case
we write it as 
!bt
\[
\Psi_C= \exp{\left\{\sum_{i < j}\frac{ar_{ij}}{1+\beta r_{ij}}\right\}},
\]
!et
which means that the gradient needed for the so-called quantum force and local energy 
can be calculated analytically.
This will speed up your code since the computation of the correlation part and the Slater determinant are the most 
time consuming parts in your code.  

We will refer to this correlation function as $\Psi_C$ or the *linear Pade-Jastrow*.
!eblock

!split
===== The first attempt at solving the Helium atom =====
!bblock

We can test this by computing the local energy for our helium wave function
!bt
\[
   \psi_{T}(\bm{r}_1,\bm{r}_2) = 
   \exp{\left(-\alpha(r_1+r_2)\right)}
   \exp{\left(\frac{r_{12}}{2(1+\beta r_{12})}\right)}, 
\]
!et
with $\alpha$ and $\beta$ as variational parameters.

The local energy is for this case 
!bt
\[ 
E_{L2} = E_{L1}+\frac{1}{2(1+\beta r_{12})^2}\left\{\frac{\alpha(r_1+r_2)}{r_{12}}(1-\frac{\bm{r}_1\bm{r}_2}{r_1r_2})-\frac{1}{2(1+\beta r_{12})^2}-\frac{2}{r_{12}}+\frac{2\beta}{1+\beta r_{12}}\right\}
\]
!et
It is very useful to test your code against these expressions. It means also that you don't need to
compute a derivative numerically as discussed in the code example below.

For the computation of various derivatives with different types of wave functions, you will find it useful to use python with symbolic python, that is sympy, see URL: "http://docs.sympy.org/latest/index.html".  Using sympy allows you autogenerate both Latex code as well c++, python or Fortran codes. Here you will find some simple examples. We choose 
the $2s$ hydrogen-orbital  (not normalized) as an example
!bt
\[
 \phi_{2s}(\bm{r}) = (Zr - 2)\exp{-(\frac{1}{2}Zr)},
\]
!et
with $ r^2 = x^2 + y^2 + z^2$.

!bc pycod
from sympy import symbols, diff, exp, sqrt
x, y, z, Z = symbols('x y z Z')
r = sqrt(x*x + y*y + z*z)
r
phi = (Z*r - 2)*exp(-Z*r/2)
phi
diff(phi, x)
!ec
This doesn't look very nice, but sympy provides several functions that allow for improving and simplifying the output.

!bc pycod
from sympy import symbols, diff, exp, sqrt, factor, Symbol, printing
x, y, z, Z = symbols('x y z Z')
r = sqrt(x*x + y*y + z*z)
phi = (Z*r - 2)*exp(-Z*r/2)
R = Symbol('r') #Creates a symbolic equivalent of r
#print latex and c++ code
print printing.latex(diff(phi, x).factor().subs(r, R))
print printing.ccode(diff(phi, x).factor().subs(r, R))

!bc pycod
from sympy import symbols, diff, exp, sqrt, factor, Symbol, printing
x, y, z, Z = symbols('x y z Z')
r = sqrt(x*x + y*y + z*z)
phi = (Z*r - 2)*exp(-Z*r/2)
R = Symbol('r') #Creates a symbolic equivalent of r
(diff(diff(phi, x), x) + diff(diff(phi, y), y) + diff(diff(phi, z), z)).factor().subs(r, R)
# Collect the Z values
(diff(diff(phi, x), x) + diff(diff(phi, y), y) +diff(diff(phi, z), z)).factor().collect(Z).subs(r, R)
# Factorize also the r**2 terms
(diff(diff(phi, x), x) + diff(diff(phi, y), y) + diff(diff(phi, z), z)).factor().collect(Z).subs(r, R).subs(r**2, R**2).factor()
print printing.ccode((diff(diff(phi, x), x) + diff(diff(phi, y), y) + diff(diff(phi, z), z)).factor().collect(Z).subs(r, R).subs(r**2, R**2).factor())

===== The Metropolis algorithm =====
!bblock 
The Metropolis algorithm , see URL: "http://scitation.aip.org/content/aip/journal/jcp/21/6/10.1063/1.1699114"  (see also the FYS3150 lectures URL: "http://www.uio.no/studier/emner/matnat/fys/FYS3150/h14/index.html")
was invented by Metropolis et. al
and is often simply called the Metropolis algorithm.
It is a method to sample a normalized probability
distribution by a stochastic process. We define ${\cal P}_i^{(n)}$ to
be the probability for finding the system in the state $i$ at step $n$.
The algorithm is then

* Sample a possible new state $j$ with some probability $T_{i\rightarrow j}$.
* Accept the new state $j$ with probability $A_{i \rightarrow j}$ and use it as the next sample. With probability $1-A_{i\rightarrow j}$ the move is rejected and the original state $i$ is used again as a sample.
!eblock


!split
===== The Metropolis algorithm =====
!bblock 
We wish to derive the required properties of $T$ and $A$ such that
${\cal P}_i^{(n\rightarrow \infty)} \rightarrow p_i$ so that starting
from any distribution, the method converges to the correct distribution.
Note that the description here is for a discrete probability distribution.
Replacing probabilities $p_i$ with expressions like $p(x_i)dx_i$ will
take all of these over to the corresponding continuum expressions.

!eblock


!split
===== The Metropolis algorithm =====
!bblock 
The dynamical equation for ${\cal P}_i^{(n)}$ can be written directly from
the description above. The probability of being in the state $i$ at step $n$
is given by the probability of being in any state $j$ at the previous step,
and making an accepted transition to $i$ added to the probability of
being in the state $i$, making a transition to any state $j$ and
rejecting the move:
!bt
\[
{\cal P}^{(n)}_i = \sum_j \left [
{\cal P}^{(n-1)}_jT_{j\rightarrow i} A_{j\rightarrow i} 
+{\cal P}^{(n-1)}_iT_{i\rightarrow j}\left ( 1- A_{i\rightarrow j} \right)
\right ] \,.
\]
!et
Since the probability of making some transition must be 1,
$\sum_j T_{i\rightarrow j} = 1$, and the above equation becomes
!bt
\[
{\cal P}^{(n)}_i = {\cal P}^{(n-1)}_i +
 \sum_j \left [
{\cal P}^{(n-1)}_jT_{j\rightarrow i} A_{j\rightarrow i} 
-{\cal P}^{(n-1)}_iT_{i\rightarrow j}A_{i\rightarrow j}
\right ] \,.
\]
!et
!eblock


!split
===== The Metropolis algorithm =====
!bblock 
For large $n$ we require that ${\cal P}^{(n\rightarrow \infty)}_i = p_i$,
the desired probability distribution. Taking this limit, gives the
balance requirement
!bt
\[
 \sum_j \left [
p_jT_{j\rightarrow i} A_{j\rightarrow i}
-p_iT_{i\rightarrow j}A_{i\rightarrow j}
\right ] = 0 \,.
\]
!et
The balance requirement is very weak. Typically the much stronger detailed
balance requirement is enforced, that is rather than the sum being
set to zero, we set each term separately to zero and use this
to determine the acceptance probabilities. Rearranging, the result is
!bt
\[
\frac{ A_{j\rightarrow i}}{A_{i\rightarrow j}}
= \frac{p_iT_{i\rightarrow j}}{ p_jT_{j\rightarrow i}} \,.
\]
!et
!eblock


!split
===== The Metropolis algorithm =====
!bblock 
The Metropolis choice is to maximize the $A$ values, that is
!bt
\[
A_{j \rightarrow i} = \min \left ( 1,
\frac{p_iT_{i\rightarrow j}}{ p_jT_{j\rightarrow i}}\right ).
\]
!et
Other choices are possible, but they all correspond to multilplying
$A_{i\rightarrow j}$ and $A_{j\rightarrow i}$ by the same constant
smaller than unity.\footnote{The penalty function method uses just such
a factor to compensate for $p_i$ that are evaluated stochastically
and are therefore noisy.}
!eblock

!split
===== The Metropolis algorithm =====
!bblock 
Having chosen the acceptance probabilities, we have guaranteed that
if the  ${\cal P}_i^{(n)}$ has equilibrated, that is if it is equal to $p_i$,
it will remain equilibrated. Next we need to find the circumstances for
convergence to equilibrium.

The dynamical equation can be written as
!bt
\[
{\cal P}^{(n)}_i = \sum_j M_{ij}{\cal P}^{(n-1)}_j
\]
!et
with the matrix $M$ given by
!bt
\[
M_{ij} = \delta_{ij}\left [ 1 -\sum_k T_{i\rightarrow k} A_{i \rightarrow k}
\right ] + T_{j\rightarrow i} A_{j\rightarrow i} \,.
\]
!et
Summing over $i$ shows that $\sum_i M_{ij} = 1$, and since
$\sum_k T_{i\rightarrow k} = 1$, and $A_{i \rightarrow k} \leq 1$, the
elements of the matrix satisfy $M_{ij} \geq 0$. The matrix $M$ is therefore
a stochastic matrix.

!eblock


!split
===== The Metropolis algorithm =====
!bblock 
The Metropolis method is simply the power method for computing the
right eigenvector of $M$ with the largest magnitude eigenvalue.
By construction, the correct probability distribution is a right eigenvector
with eigenvalue 1. Therefore, for the Metropolis method to converge
to this result, we must show that $M$ has only one eigenvalue with this
magnitude, and all other eigenvalues are smaller.

===== Why blocking? ===== 
!bblock Statistical analysis
    * Monte Carlo simulations can be treated as *computer experiments*
    * The results can be analysed with the same statistical tools as we would use analysing experimental data.
    * As in all experiments, we are looking for expectation values and an estimate of how accurate they are, i.e., possible sources for errors.
!eblock    

!split
===== Why blocking? ===== 
!bblock Statistical analysis
    * As in other experiments, Monte Carlo experiments have two classes of errors:
      * Statistical errors
      * Systematical errors
    * Statistical errors can be estimated using standard tools from statistics
    * Systematical errors are method specific and must be treated differently from case to case. (In VMC a common source is the step length or time step in importance sampling)
!eblock    

!split
===== Statistics and blocking ===== 
!bblock
The *probability distribution function (PDF)* is a function
$p(x)$ on the domain which, in the discrete case, gives us the
probability or relative frequency with which these values of $X$ occur:
!bt
\[
p(x) = \mathrm{prob}(X=x)
\]
!et
In the continuous case, the PDF does not directly depict the
actual probability. Instead we define the probability for the
stochastic variable to assume any value on an infinitesimal interval
around $x$ to be $p(x)dx$. The continuous function $p(x)$ then gives us
the *density* of the probability rather than the probability
itself. The probability for a stochastic variable to assume any value
on a non-infinitesimal interval $[a,\,b]$ is then just the integral:
!bt
\[
\mathrm{prob}(a\leq X\leq b) = \int_a^b p(x)dx
\]
!et
Qualitatively speaking, a stochastic variable represents the values of
numbers chosen as if by chance from some specified PDF so that the
selection of a large set of these numbers reproduces this PDF.
!eblock

!split
===== Statistics and blocking =====
!bblock
Also of interest to us is the *cumulative probability distribution function (CDF)*, $P(x)$, which is just the probability
for a stochastic variable $X$ to assume any value less than $x$:
!bt
\[
P(x)=\mathrm{Prob(}X\leq x\mathrm{)} =\int_{-\infty}^x p(x^{\prime})dx^{\prime}
\]
!et
The relation between a CDF and its corresponding PDF is then:
!bt
\[
p(x) = \frac{d}{dx}P(x)
\]
!et
!eblock

!split
===== Statistics and blocking =====
!bblock
A particularly useful class of special expectation values are the
*moments*. The $n$-th moment of the PDF $p$ is defined as
follows:
!bt
\[
\langle x^n\rangle \equiv \int\! x^n p(x)\,dx
\]
!et
The zero-th moment $\langle 1\rangle$ is just the normalization condition of
$p$. The first moment, $\langle x\rangle$, is called the *mean* of $p$
and often denoted by the letter $\mu$:
!bt
\[
\langle x\rangle = \mu \equiv \int\! x p(x)\,dx
\]
!et
!eblock

!split
===== Statistics and blocking =====
!bblock
A special version of the moments is the set of *central moments*,
the n-th central moment defined as:
!bt
\[
\langle (x-\langle x \rangle )^n\rangle \equiv \int\! (x-\langle x\rangle)^n p(x)\,dx
\]
!et
The zero-th and first central moments are both trivial, equal $1$ and
$0$, respectively. But the second central moment, known as the
*variance* of $p$, is of particular interest. For the stochastic
variable $X$, the variance is denoted as $\sigma^2_X$ or $\mathrm{var}(X)$:
!bt
\begin{eqnarray}
\sigma^2_X\ \ =\ \ \mathrm{var}(X) & = & \langle (x-\langle x\rangle)^2\rangle =
\int\! (x-\langle x\rangle)^2 p(x)\,dx\\
& = & \int\! \left(x^2 - 2 x \langle x\rangle^{2} +
  \langle x\rangle^2\right)p(x)\,dx\\
& = & \langle x^2\rangle - 2 \langle x\rangle\langle x\rangle + \langle x\rangle^2\\
& = & \langle x^2\rangle - \langle x\rangle^2
\end{eqnarray}
!et
The square root of the variance, $\sigma =\sqrt{\langle (x-\langle x\rangle)^2\rangle}$ is called the *standard deviation* of $p$. It is clearly just the RMS (root-mean-square)
value of the deviation of the PDF from its mean value, interpreted
qualitatively as the *spread* of $p$ around its mean.
!eblock

!split
===== Statistics and blocking =====
!bblock
Another important quantity is the so called covariance, a variant of
the above defined variance. Consider again the set $\{X_i\}$ of $n$
stochastic variables (not necessarily uncorrelated) with the
multivariate PDF $P(x_1,\dots,x_n)$. The *covariance* of two
of the stochastic variables, $X_i$ and $X_j$, is defined as follows:
!bt
\begin{eqnarray}
\mathrm{cov}(X_i,\,X_j) &\equiv& \langle (x_i-\langle x_i\rangle)(x_j-\langle x_j\rangle)\rangle
\nonumber\\
&=&
\int\!\cdots\!\int\!(x_i-\langle x_i \rangle)(x_j-\langle x_j \rangle)\,
P(x_1,\dots,x_n)\,dx_1\dots dx_n
label{eq:def_covariance}
\end{eqnarray}
!et
with
!bt
\[
\langle x_i\rangle =
\int\!\cdots\!\int\!x_i\,P(x_1,\dots,x_n)\,dx_1\dots dx_n
\]
!et
!eblock

!split
===== Statistics and blocking =====
!bblock
If we consider the above covariance as a matrix $C_{ij}=\mathrm{cov}(X_i,\,X_j)$, then the diagonal elements are just the familiar
variances, $C_{ii} = \mathrm{cov}(X_i,\,X_i) = \mathrm{var}(X_i)$. It turns out that
all the off-diagonal elements are zero if the stochastic variables are
uncorrelated. This is easy to show, keeping in mind the linearity of
the expectation value. Consider the stochastic variables $X_i$ and
$X_j$, ($i\neq j$):
!bt
\begin{eqnarray}
\mathrm{cov}(X_i,\,X_j) &=& \langle(x_i-\langle x_i\rangle)(x_j-\langle x_j\rangle)\rangle\\
&=&\langle x_i x_j - x_i\langle x_j\rangle - \langle x_i\rangle x_j + \langle x_i\rangle\langle x_j\rangle\rangle \\
&=&\langle x_i x_j\rangle - \langle x_i\langle x_j\rangle\rangle - \langle \langle x_i\rangle x_j\rangle +
\langle \langle x_i\rangle\langle x_j\rangle\rangle\\
&=&\langle x_i x_j\rangle - \langle x_i\rangle\langle x_j\rangle - \langle x_i\rangle\langle x_j\rangle +
\langle x_i\rangle\langle x_j\rangle\\
&=&\langle x_i x_j\rangle - \langle x_i\rangle\langle x_j\rangle
\end{eqnarray}
!et
!eblock



!split
===== Statistics and blocking =====
!bblock
If $X_i$ and $X_j$ are independent, we get 
$\langle x_i x_j\rangle =\langle x_i\rangle\langle x_j\rangle$, resulting in $\mathrm{cov}(X_i, X_j) = 0\ \ (i\neq j)$.

Also useful for us is the covariance of linear combinations of
stochastic variables. Let $\{X_i\}$ and $\{Y_i\}$ be two sets of
stochastic variables. Let also $\{a_i\}$ and $\{b_i\}$ be two sets of
scalars. Consider the linear combination:

Now, since the variance is just $\mathrm{var}(X_i) = \mathrm{cov}(X_i, X_i)$, we get
the variance of the linear combination $U = \sum_i a_i X_i$:

And in the special case when the stochastic variables are

A *stochastic process* is a process that produces sequentially a
chain of values:
!bt
\[
\{x_1, x_2,\dots\,x_k,\dots\}.

We will call these
values our *measurements* and the entire set as our measured
*sample*.  The action of measuring all the elements of a sample
we will call a stochastic *experiment* since, operationally,
they are often associated with results of empirical observation of
some physical or mathematical phenomena; precisely an experiment. We
assume that these values are distributed according to some 
PDF $p_X^{\phantom X}(x)$, where $X$ is just the formal symbol for the
stochastic variable whose PDF is $p_X^{\phantom X}(x)$. Instead of
trying to determine the full distribution $p$ we are often only
interested in finding the few lowest moments, like the mean
$\mu_X^{\phantom X}$ and the variance $\sigma_X^{\phantom X}$.

In practical situations a sample is always of finite size. Let that
size be $n$. The expectation value of a sample, the *sample mean*, is then defined as follows:
!bt
\[
\bar{x}_n \equiv \frac{1}{n}\sum_{k=1}^n x_k
\]

The *sample variance* is:
!bt
\[
\mathrm{var}(x) \equiv \frac{1}{n}\sum_{k=1}^n (x_k - \bar{x}_n)^2
\]
!et
its square root being the *standard deviation of the sample*. The
*sample covariance* is:

\[

Note that the sample variance is the sample covariance without the
cross terms. In a similar manner as the covariance in Eq.~(ref{eq:def_covariance}) is a measure of the correlation between
two stochastic variables, the above defined sample covariance is a
measure of the sequential correlation between succeeding measurements
of a sample.

These quantities, being known experimental values, differ
significantly from and must not be confused with the similarly named
quantities for stochastic variables, mean $\mu_X$, variance $\mathrm{var}(X)$
and covariance $\mathrm{cov}(X,Y)$.

The law of large numbers
states that as the size of our sample grows to infinity, the sample
mean approaches the true mean $\mu_X^{\phantom X}$ of the chosen PDF:
!bt
\[
\lim_{n\to\infty}\bar{x}_n = \mu_X^{\phantom X}
\]
!et
The sample mean $\bar{x}_n$ works therefore as an estimate of the true
mean $\mu_X^{\phantom X}$.

What we need to find out is how good an approximation $\bar{x}_n$ is to
$\mu_X^{\phantom X}$. In any stochastic measurement, an estimated
mean is of no use to us without a measure of its error. A quantity
that tells us how well we can reproduce it in another experiment. We
are therefore interested in the PDF of the sample mean itself. Its
standard deviation will be a measure of the spread of sample means,
and we will simply call it the *error* of the sample mean, or
just sample error, and denote it by $\mathrm{err}_X^{\phantom X}$. In
practice, we will only be able to produce an *estimate* of the
sample error since the exact value would require the knowledge of the
true PDFs behind, which we usually do not have.
!eblock

!split
===== Statistics and blocking =====
!bblock
The straight forward brute force way of estimating the sample error is
simply by producing a number of samples, and treating the mean of each
as a measurement. The standard deviation of these means will then be
an estimate of the original sample error. If we are unable to produce
more than one sample, we can split it up sequentially into smaller
ones, treating each in the same way as above. This procedure is known
as *blocking* and will be given more attention shortly. At this
point it is worth while exploring more indirect methods of estimation
that will help us understand some important underlying principles of
correlational effects.

Let us first take a look at what happens to the sample error as the
size of the sample grows. In a sample, each of the measurements $x_i$
can be associated with its own stochastic variable $X_i$. The
stochastic variable $\overline X_n$ for the sample mean $\bar{x}_n$ is
then just a linear combination, already familiar to us:
!bt
\[
\overline X_n = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n X_i
\]
!et
All the coefficients are just equal $1/n$. The PDF of $\overline X_n$,
denoted by $p_{\overline X_n}(x)$ is the desired PDF of the sample
means. 
!eblock

===== Statistics and blocking =====

The probability density of obtaining a sample mean $\bar x_n$
is the product of probabilities of obtaining arbitrary values $x_1,
x_2,\dots,x_n$ with the constraint that the mean of the set $\{x_i\}$
is $\bar x_n$:
!bt
\[
p_{\overline X_n}(x) = \int p_X^{\phantom X}(x_1)\cdots
\int p_X^{\phantom X}(x_n)\ 
\delta\!\left(x - \frac{x_1+x_2+\dots+x_n}{n}\right)dx_n \cdots dx_1
\]
!et
And in particular we are interested in its variance $\mathrm{var}(\overline X_n)$.
!eblock



!split
===== Statistics and blocking =====
!bblock
It is generally not possible to express $p_{\overline X_n}(x)$ in a
closed form given an arbitrary PDF $p_X^{\phantom X}$ and a number
$n$. But for the limit $n\to\infty$ it is possible to make an
approximation. The very important result is called *the central limit theorem*. It tells us that as $n$ goes to infinity,
$p_{\overline X_n}(x)$ approaches a Gaussian distribution whose mean
and variance equal the true mean and variance, $\mu_{X}^{\phantom X}$
and $\sigma_{X}^{2}$, respectively:
!bt
\begin{equation}
\lim_{n\to\infty} p_{\overline X_n}(x) =
\left(\frac{n}{2\pi\mathrm{var}(X)}\right)^{1/2}
e^{-\frac{n(x-\bar x_n)^2}{2\mathrm{var}(X)}}
label{eq:central_limit_gaussian}
\end{equation}
!et
!eblock

===== Statistics and blocking =====
!bblock
The desired variance
$\mathrm{var}(\overline X_n)$, i.e. the sample error squared
$\mathrm{err}_X^2$, is given by:
!bt
\begin{equation}
\mathrm{err}_X^2 = \mathrm{var}(\overline X_n) = \frac{1}{n^2}
\sum_{ij} \mathrm{cov}(X_i, X_j)
label{eq:error_exact}
\end{equation}
!et
We see now that in order to calculate the exact error of the sample
with the above expression, we would need the true means
$\mu_{X_i}^{\phantom X}$ of the stochastic variables $X_i$. To
calculate these requires that we know the true multivariate PDF of all
the $X_i$. But this PDF is unknown to us, we have only got the measurements of
one sample. The best we can do is to let the sample itself be an
estimate of the PDF of each of the $X_i$, estimating all properties of
$X_i$ through the measurements of the sample.
!eblock

===== Statistics and blocking =====

Our estimate of $\mu_{X_i}^{\phantom X}$ is then the sample mean $\bar x$
itself, in accordance with the the central limit theorem:
!bt
\[
\mu_{X_i}^{\phantom X} = \langle x_i\rangle \approx \frac{1}{n}\sum_{k=1}^n x_k = \bar x
\]
!et
Using $\bar x$ in place of $\mu_{X_i}^{\phantom X}$ we can give an
*estimate* of the covariance in Eq.~(ref{eq:error_exact})
!bt
\[
\mathrm{cov}(X_i, X_j) = \langle (x_i-\langle x_i\rangle)(x_j-\langle x_j\rangle)\rangle
\approx\langle (x_i - \bar x)(x_j - \bar{x})\rangle,
\]
!et
resulting in
!bt
\[ 
\frac{1}{n} \sum_{l}^n \left(\frac{1}{n}\sum_{k}^n (x_k -\bar x_n)(x_l - \bar x_n)\right)=\frac{1}{n}\frac{1}{n} \sum_{kl} (x_k -\bar x_n)(x_l - \bar x_n)=\frac{1}{n}\mathrm{cov}(x)
\]
!et
!eblock

!split
===== Statistics and blocking =====
!bblock
By the same procedure we can use the sample variance as an
estimate of the variance of any of the stochastic variables $X_i$
!bt
\[
\mathrm{var}(X_i)=\langle x_i - \langle x_i\rangle\rangle \approx \langle x_i - \bar x_n\rangle\nonumber,
\]
!et
which is approximated as 
!bt
\begin{equation}
\mathrm{var}(X_i)\approx \frac{1}{n}\sum_{k=1}^n (x_k - \bar x_n)=\mathrm{var}(x)
label{eq:var_estimate_i_think}
\end{equation}
!et

Now we can calculate an estimate of the error
$\mathrm{err}_X^{\phantom X}$ of the sample mean $\bar x_n$:
!bt
\begin{eqnarray}
\mathrm{err}_X^2
&=&\frac{1}{n^2}\sum_{ij} \mathrm{cov}(X_i, X_j) \nonumber \\
&\approx&\frac{1}{n^2}\sum_{ij}\frac{1}{n}\mathrm{cov}(x) =\frac{1}{n^2}n^2\frac{1}{n}\mathrm{cov}(x)\nonumber\\
&=&\frac{1}{n}\mathrm{cov}(x)
label{eq:error_estimate}
\end{eqnarray}
!et
which is nothing but the sample covariance divided by the number of
measurements in the sample.
!eblock

!split
===== Statistics and blocking =====
!bblock

In the special case that the measurements of the sample are
uncorrelated (equivalently the stochastic variables $X_i$ are
uncorrelated) we have that the off-diagonal elements of the covariance
are zero. This gives the following estimate of the sample error:
!bt
\[
\mathrm{err}_X^2=\frac{1}{n^2}\sum_{ij} \mathrm{cov}(X_i, X_j) =
\frac{1}{n^2} \sum_i \mathrm{var}(X_i),
\]
!et
resulting in
!bt
\begin{equation}
\mathrm{err}_X^2\approx \frac{1}{n^2} \sum_i \mathrm{var}(x)= \frac{1}{n}\mathrm{var}(x)
label{eq:error_estimate_uncorrel}
\end{equation}
!et
where in the second step we have used Eq.~(ref{eq:var_estimate_i_think}).
The error of the sample is then just its standard deviation divided by
the square root of the number of measurements the sample contains.
This is a very useful formula which is easy to compute. It acts as a
first approximation to the error, but in numerical experiments, we
cannot overlook the always present correlations.

===== Statistics and blocking =====

For computational purposes one usually splits up the estimate of
$\mathrm{err}_X^2$, given by Eq.~(ref{eq:error_estimate}), into two
parts
!bt
\[
\mathrm{err}_X^2 = \frac{1}{n}\mathrm{var}(x) + \frac{1}{n}(\mathrm{cov}(x)-\mathrm{var}(x)),
\]
!et
which equals
!bt
\begin{equation}
\frac{1}{n^2}\sum_{k=1}^n (x_k - \bar x_n)^2 +\frac{2}{n^2}\sum_{k<l} (x_k - \bar x_n)(x_l - \bar x_n)
label{eq:error_estimate_split_up}
\end{equation}
!et
The first term is the same as the error in the uncorrelated case,
Eq.~(ref{eq:error_estimate_uncorrel}). This means that the second
term accounts for the error correction due to correlation between the
measurements. For uncorrelated measurements this second term is zero.
!eblock

!split
===== Statistics and blocking =====

Computationally the uncorrelated first term is much easier to treat
efficiently than the second.
!bt
\[
\mathrm{var}(x) = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{k=1}^n (x_k - \bar x_n)^2 =
\left(\frac{1}{n}\sum_{k=1}^n x_k^2\right) - \bar x_n^2
\]
!et
We just accumulate separately the values $x^2$ and $x$ for every
measurement $x$ we receive. The correlation term, though, has to be
calculated at the end of the experiment since we need all the
measurements to calculate the cross terms. Therefore, all measurements
have to be stored throughout the experiment.

Let us analyze the problem by splitting up the correlation term into
partial sums of the form:
!bt
\[
f_d = \frac{1}{n-d}\sum_{k=1}^{n-d}(x_k - \bar x_n)(x_{k+d} - \bar x_n)
\]
!et
The correlation term of the error can now be rewritten in terms of
$f_d$
!bt
\[
\frac{2}{n}\sum_{k<l} (x_k - \bar x_n)(x_l - \bar x_n) =
2\sum_{d=1}^{n-1} f_d
\]
!et
The value of $f_d$ reflects the correlation between measurements
separated by the distance $d$ in the sample samples.  Notice that for
$d=0$, $f$ is just the sample variance, $\mathrm{var}(x)$. If we divide $f_d$
by $\mathrm{var}(x)$, we arrive at the so called *autocorrelation function*
!bt
\[
\kappa_d = \frac{f_d}{\mathrm{var}(x)}
\]
!et
which gives us a useful measure of the correlation pair correlation
starting always at $1$ for $d=0$.
!eblock


!split
===== Statistics and blocking =====

The sample error (see eq.~(ref{eq:error_estimate_split_up})) can now be
written in terms of the autocorrelation function:
!bt
\begin{eqnarray}
\mathrm{err}_X^2 &=&
\frac{1}{n}\mathrm{var}(x)+\frac{2}{n}\cdot\mathrm{var}(x)\sum_{d=1}^{n-1}
\frac{f_d}{\mathrm{var}(x)}\nonumber\\ &=&
\left(1+2\sum_{d=1}^{n-1}\kappa_d\right)\frac{1}{n}\mathrm{var}(x)\nonumber\\
&=&\frac{\tau}{n}\cdot\mathrm{var}(x)
label{eq:error_estimate_corr_time}
\end{eqnarray}
!et
and we see that $\mathrm{err}_X$ can be expressed in terms the
uncorrelated sample variance times a correction factor $\tau$ which
accounts for the correlation between measurements. We call this
correction factor the *autocorrelation time*:
!bt
\begin{equation}
\tau = 1+2\sum_{d=1}^{n-1}\kappa_d
label{eq:autocorrelation_time}

For a correlation free experiment, $\tau$
equals 1. From the point of view of
eq.~(ref{eq:error_estimate_corr_time}) we can interpret a sequential
correlation as an effective reduction of the number of measurements by
a factor $\tau$. The effective number of measurements becomes:
!bt
\[
n_\mathrm{eff} = \frac{n}{\tau}
\]
!et
To neglect the autocorrelation time $\tau$ will always cause our
simple uncorrelated estimate of $\mathrm{err}_X^2\approx \mathrm{var}(x)/n$ to
be less than the true sample error. The estimate of the error will be
too *good*. On the other hand, the calculation of the full
autocorrelation time poses an efficiency problem if the set of
measurements is very large.

The so-called time-displacement autocorrelation $\phi(t)$ for a quantity ${\cal M}$ is given by

\[
\phi(t) = \int dt' \left[{\cal M}(t')-\langle {\cal M} \rangle\right]\left[{\cal M}(t'+t)-\langle {\cal M} \rangle\right],

where $\langle {\cal M} \rangle$ is the average value and
${\cal M}(t)$ its instantaneous value. We can discretize this function as follows, where we used our
set of computed values ${\cal M}(t)$ for a set of discretized times (our Monte Carlo cycles corresponding to moving all electrons?)
!bt
\[
\phi(t)  = \frac{1}{t_{\mathrm{max}}-t}\sum_{t'=0}^{t_{\mathrm{max}}-t}{\cal M}(t'){\cal M}(t'+t)
-\frac{1}{t_{\mathrm{max}}-t}\sum_{t'=0}^{t_{\mathrm{max}}-t}{\cal M}(t')\times

!split
===== Time Auto-correlation Function =====
!bblock
One should be careful with times close to $t_{\mathrm{max}}$, the upper limit of the sums 
becomes small and we end up integrating over a rather small time interval. This means that the statistical
error in $\phi(t)$ due to the random nature of the fluctuations in ${\cal M}(t)$ can become large.

One should therefore choose $t \ll t_{\mathrm{max}}$.

Note that the variable ${\cal M}$ can be any expectation values of interest.



The time-correlation function gives a measure of the correlation between the various values of the variable 
at a time $t'$ and a time $t'+t$. If we multiply the values of ${\cal M}$ at these two different times,
we will get a positive contribution if they are fluctuating in the same direction, or a negative value
if they fluctuate in the opposite direction. If we then integrate over time, or use the discretized version of, the time correlation function $\phi(t)$ should take a non-zero value if the fluctuations are 
correlated, else it should gradually go to zero. For times a long way apart 
the different values of ${\cal M}$  are most likely 
uncorrelated and $\phi(t)$ should be zero.

\[

with $\mathbf{\hat{w}}(0)$ the distribution at $t=0$ and $\mathbf{\hat{W}}$ representing the

$\mathbf{\hat{v}}$ of $\mathbf{\hat{W}}$ as

the eigenvector $\mathbf{\hat{v}}_i$.

If we assume that $\lambda_0$ is the largest eigenvector we see that in the limit $t\rightarrow \infty$,
$\mathbf{\hat{w}}(t)$ becomes proportional to the corresponding eigenvector

We can relate this property to an observable like the mean energy.

The quantities $\tau_i$ are the correlation times for the system. They control also the auto-correlation function 
discussed above.  The longest correlation time is obviously given by the second largest
eigenvalue $\tau_1$, which normally defines the correlation time discussed above. For large times, this is the 
only correlation time that survives. If higher eigenvalues of the transition matrix are well separated from 
$\lambda_1$ and we simulate long enough,  $\tau_1$ may well define the correlation time. 
In other cases we may not be able to extract a reliable result for $\tau_1$. 
Coming back to the time correlation function $\phi(t)$ we can present a more general definition in terms
of the mean magnetizations $ \langle {\cal M}(t) \rangle$. Recalling that the mean value is equal 
to $ \langle {\cal M}(\infty) \rangle$ we arrive at the expectation values

An excellent reference on topics like Brownian motion, Markov chains, the Fokker-Planck equation and the Langevin equation is the text by  Van Kampen, see URL: "http://www.elsevier.com/books/stochastic-processes-in-physics-and-chemistry/van-kampen/978-0-444-52965-7"
Here we will focus first on the implementation part first.

For a diffusion process characterized by a time-dependent probability density $P(x,t)$ in one dimension the Fokker-Planck
equation reads (for one particle /walker) 
!bt
\[
   \frac{\partial P}{\partial t} = D\frac{\partial }{\partial x}\left(\frac{\partial }{\partial x} -F\right)P(x,t),
\]
!et
where $F$ is a drift term and $D$ is the diffusion coefficient.

The new positions in coordinate space are given as the solutions of the Langevin equation using Euler's method, namely,
we go from the Langevin equation
!bt
\[ 
   \frac{\partial x(t)}{\partial t} = DF(x(t)) +\eta,
\]
!et
with $\eta$ a random variable,
yielding a new position 
!bt
\[
   y = x+DF(x)\Delta t +\xi\sqrt{\Delta t},
\]
!et
where $\xi$ is gaussian random variable and $\Delta t$ is a chosen time step. 
The quantity $D$ is, in atomic units, equal to $1/2$ and comes from the factor $1/2$ in the kinetic energy operator. Note that $\Delta t$ is to be viewed as a parameter. Values of $\Delta t \in [0.001,0.01]$ yield in general rather stable values of the ground statenergy.

The process of isotropic diffusion characterized by a time-dependent probability density $P(\mathbf{x},t)$ obeys (as an approximation) the so-called Fokker-Planck equation 
!bt
\[
   \frac{\partial P}{\partial t} = \sum_i D\frac{\partial }{\partial \mathbf{x_i}}\left(\frac{\partial }{\partial \mathbf{x_i}} -\mathbf{F_i}\right)P(\mathbf{x},t),
\]
!et
where $\mathbf{F_i}$ is the $i^{th}$ component of the drift term (drift velocity) caused by an external potential, and $D$ is the diffusion coefficient. The convergence to a stationary probability density can be obtained by setting the left hand side to zero. The resulting equation will be satisfied if and only if all the terms of the sum are equal zero,
!bt
\[
\frac{\partial^2 P}{\partial {\mathbf{x_i}^2}} = P\frac{\partial}{\partial {\mathbf{x_i}}}\mathbf{F_i} + \mathbf{F_i}\frac{\partial}{\partial {\mathbf{x_i}}}P.
\]

The drift vector should be of the form $\mathbf{F} = g(\mathbf{x}) \frac{\partial P}{\partial \mathbf{x}}$. Then,
!bt
\[
\frac{\partial^2 P}{\partial {\mathbf{x_i}^2}} = P\frac{\partial g}{\partial P}\left( \frac{\partial P}{\partial {\mathbf{x}_i}}  \right)^2 + P g \frac{\partial ^2 P}{\partial {\mathbf{x}_i^2}}  + g \left( \frac{\partial P}{\partial {\mathbf{x}_i}}  \right)^2.
\]
!et
The condition of stationary density means that the left hand side equals zero. In other words, the terms containing first and second derivatives have to cancel each other. It is possible only if $g = \frac{1}{P}$, which yields
!bt
\[
\mathbf{F} = 2\frac{1}{\Psi_T}\nabla\Psi_T,
\]
!et
which is known as the so-called *quantum force*. This term is responsible for pushing the walker towards regions of configuration space where the trial wave function is large, increasing the efficiency of the simulation in contrast to the Metropolis algorithm where the walker has the same probability of moving in every direction.

The Fokker-Planck equation yields a (the solution to the equation) transition probability given by the Green's function

In the Metropolis/Hasting algorithm, the *acceptance ratio* determines the probability for a particle  to be accepted at a new position. The ratio of the trial wave functions evaluated at the new and current positions is given by ($D$ for determinant part)

A stochastic process is simply a function of two variables, one is the time,
the other is a stochastic variable $X$, defined by specifying
* the set $\left\{x\right\}$ of possible values for $X$;
* the probability distribution, $w_X(x)$,  over this set, or briefly $w(x)$

The set of values $\left\{x\right\}$ for $X$ 
may be discrete, or continuous. If the set of
values is continuous, then $w_X (x)$ is a probability density so that 
$w_X (x)dx$
is the probability that one finds the stochastic variable $X$ to have values
in the range $[x, x + dx]$ .

The solution represents the probability of finding
our random walker at position ${\bf x}$ at time $t$ if the initial distribution 
was placed at ${\bf x}=0$ at $t=0$. 

There is another interesting feature worth observing. The discrete transition probability $W$
itself is given by a binomial distribution.
The results from the central limit theorem state that 
transition probability in the limit $n\rightarrow \infty$ converges to the normal 
distribution. It is then possible to show that

Consider a particle  suspended in a liquid. On its path through the liquid it will continuously collide with the liquid molecules. Because on average the particle  will collide more often on the front side than on the back side, it will experience a systematic force proportional with its velocity, and directed opposite to its velocity. Besides this systematic force the particle  will experience a stochastic force  $\mathbf{F}(t)$. 
The equations of motion are 
* $\frac{d\mathbf{r}}{dt}=\mathbf{v}$ and 
* $\frac{d\mathbf{v}}{dt}=-\xi \mathbf{v}+\mathbf{F}$.

\[
\langle \mathbf{F}(t)\cdot \mathbf{F}(t^{\prime })\rangle =6\frac{kT}{m}\xi \delta (t-t^{\prime }).
